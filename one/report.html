							<h2>I.<span class="indent-tab-one"></span>Executive Summary</h2>
							<p>Budget Buddy, Inc. (hereinafter, “the company”) enjoys a unique opportunity to incorporate AI-derived software features into its flagship consumer smartphone software product (hereinafter, “the AI solution”). This report summarizes the results of investigation by the company’s informational technology department’s research group into the feasibility of such an endeavor, which investigative results find that it would be both feasible and provide a significant return on investment to the company to invest in further research to identify actionable trends in user personal spending behavior.</p>

							<h2>II.<span class="indent-tab-one"></span>Investigation Undertaken</h2>
							<p>The company is engaged in developing a smartphone app that assists public consumer users in identifying and managing their personal and household spending to achieve their financial planning goals, primarily by presenting users with budgeting tips and promotional offers on consumer products they have expressed interest in purchasing or have an established history of purchasing.</p>
							<p>Prior market research has established a strong demand signal for such app features in the consumer financial services industry (Rane, Choudhary and Rane, 2024); likewise, the use of AI-derived software features in the financial sector is accepted and widespread. Such solutions have been implemented for a wide variety of subject matter domains, including the analysis of regulatory financial filings, predicting the expected value of investment opportunities, and engaging in fraud detection in point of sale and credit card-based transactions (Cao et al, 2024).</p>
							<p>Before adopting any type of AI-derived solution, however, company leadership has requested a proof of concept investigation that confirms that company resources would be efficiently allocated in doing so, and that the AI solution would provide material and actionable results. This report describes the methodology and results of one such investigation that clearly support the adoption of an AI solution by company leadership.</p>
